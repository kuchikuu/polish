Basic sentences.

There are few "levels" of words a person can use to greet someone.
Let's start with most formal and common greetings. 

	When you see someone and want to start a conversation:

	Dzień dobry.	- Good morning + Good afternoon
	Dobry wieczór.	- Good evening


	When you want to end a conversation:

	Czy wszystko w porządku? - Is everything alright? (Can't think of other questions at this level)


	When you want to answer:

	(Czy wszystko w porządku?) Tak, a u Pana/Pani?	-Yes, and you?(Pana for men, Pani for women)


	When you want to end a conversation:

	Do widzenia. - See you later


Let's go level lower. This will be Formal, but not AS formal.

	When you see someone and want to start a conversation:
	
	Witam.	- Hello


	When you want to end a conversation:

	Miłego dnia.		- See you later, have a nice day.
	Miłego wieczoru.	- See you later, have a nice evening.

	Do widzenia, miłego dnia.	- See you later, have a nice day.
	Do widzenia, miłego wieczoru.	- See you later, have a nice evening.
	(Once you leave a shop, and want to say goodbye to the cashier, it's a nice thing to wish the person a nice day, at least that's what I'm doing. You can also say it to others, but I don't think it's suitable for very formal situations)
	
	Do usłyszenia	- "Hear you later", it is mostly used at the end of a phone call, since you can't "see" the person per say, so we use a phrase oriented towards hearing.
	
	Żegnam	- "Farewell" (In my opinion it is quite harsh. It is mostly used when you want the other person to leave, so you throw a strong and definitive "Żegnam.", suggesting that a person should leave. That is, if used first. If someone says "Do widzenia", you could possibly say "Żegnam" without any consequences.)



Let's go level lower. This will be informal, towards a friend, that is a friend but not as close as one might think:

	When you see someone and want to start a conversation:

	Hej	- Hi
	Hejka	- Hi(more "loose/cool")
	Cześć	- Hello

	When you want to ask how is the other person doing:

	Jak się masz?		- How are you?
	Co słychać?		- How ae you?/What's up?(lit. What can be heard from you?)
	Wszystko w porządku?	- Is everything alright?

	When you want to answer:

	(Jak leci?Jak się masz?)Dobrze / nie najlepiej	- Good/Not that good
	(Co słychać?)Po staremu				- Nothing new (lit. goes like before)
	(Wszystko w porządku?)Tak / Nie			- Yes/No


	When you want to end a conversation:

	Cześć 			- Bye ( We use "Cześć" for a greeting and for a farewell. Same as "Ciao" in Italian)
	Muszę leciec, cześć 	- I have to go, bye
	Do później		- Till later
	Do zobaczenia jutro	- See you tomorrow


Let's go level lower. This will be informal, towards a friend, with whom you can get away with most of the stuff(Slang):

	When you see someone and want to start a conversation:
	
	Siema		- Hi
	Siemka		- Hi
	Siemano		- Hi
	Siemanko	- Hi
	Hej (ziom)	- Hi (dude)
	Hejka (ziom)	- Hi (dude)
	Cześć		- Hello

	When you want to ask how is the other person doing:

	Co tam?			- What's up?
	Jak leci?		- What's up?
	Co słychać?		- How are you?/What's up?
	Co tam u ciebie?	- How are things going?
	Wszystko w porządku?	- Is everything alright?
	Co nowego?		- What's new?

	When you want to answer:
	
	(Co tam?)Ok / Słabo			- Ok, Not too well (very poor)
	(Jak leci?)Całkiem Całkiem		- Not too bad
	(Co słychać?)Po staremu			- Nothing new (lit. goes like before)
	(Wszystko w porządku?)Tak / Nie		- Yes/No

	When you want to end a conversation:
	Siema			- Bye
	Siemka			- Bye
	Siemano			- Bye
	Siemanko		- Bye
	Cześć			- Bye
	Nara			- Bye
	Muszę leciec, cześć	- I have to go, bye.
	Muszę leciec, pa	- I have to go, bye.
	Trzymaj się		- Take care (lit. Hold yourself)
	Pa			- Bye
	Papa			- Bye
	Papapa			- Bye ( I think "papapa" is already long enough to be seen strange. Definitely Man-Man conversation would seem gay, but as I wrote before, it all depends of "how close you are with your friend". Man-Woman wouldn't be strange, and Woman-Man, Woman-Woman is not strange. Women can get away with more stuff than men, as in my opinion "papa" is kind of cute)
