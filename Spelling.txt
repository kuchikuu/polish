Spelling Polish words
There are two ways to spell a letter.
„Alphabet”-like, and „Sound-In-Actual-Words”-like.
Here is the latter.
With these sounds you can start spelling even the hardest and longest words
because no matter where the letter is, it always sounds the same. (In your
face, English Language)
A – like „A” in „Alex”
B – is like „B” in „Book” or „Banana”
C – is like „C” in Chinese pinyin „ ci ”
D – is like „D” in „Door”
E – is like „E” in „Elephant”
F – is like „F” in „Finger”
G – is like „G” in „Game”
H – is like „H” in „Huge”
I – is like „I” in „Internet”
J – is like „Y” in „Yeti”
K – is like „K” in „Kitchen”
L – is like „L” in „Lake”
M – is like „M” in „Mother”
N – is like „N” in „Night”
O – is like „O” in „Open”
P – is like „P” in „Pizza”
Q – doesn’t occur in Polish Language
R – is like „R” in „Road”
S – is like „S” in „Sebastian”
T – is like „T” in „Today”
U – is like „oo” in „Book”
V – doesn’t occur in Polish Language
W – is like „V” in „Venom”
X – doesn’t occur in Polish Language, but sounds like „x” in „Taxi”
Y – is like the „i” part in Chinese pinyin „Chi”
Z – is like „Z” in „Zoo”
Now say only the first letter (except in „u”) of each example word, and you
will get the sounds that you can use to spell Polish words. Great!
But we’re not done yet. There are some nasty „clusters” of letters that even
though they consist of 2 letters, they sound only as 1. 
There are also additional letters specific to Polish Language. Let’s start with
these first
Ą (A with a little tail) – like „on” in English word „Wrong”
Ć (C with a dash) – like Chinese pinyin „Qi”
Ę (E with a little tail) – like Ą, but sounds like E” instead of „O”
(Good luck with that)
Ł (L with a line going across) – like „W” in „Window”
Ń (N with a dash) – same as „N” but with English „ee” at the end. „Nee”
 or like „ni” in English word „Onion”
Ó (O with a dash) – same like polish „U” (like „oo” in „Book”)
Ś (S with a dash) – similar to Chinese „Xi”. (Not quite but close enough)
Ż (Z with a dot) – like „ J ” in French „ Je ”
Ź (Z with a dash) – imagine saying French „ J „ and adding English „ee”
 to it. „ Jee ” (I am not kidding, we DO use it)
 But the „J” must be quite soft! Not HARD!”
In addition, because of simple estetics, before „ i ” there will never be a letter
with a dash. But whenever a letter has a „dash version” and is placed before
„ i ”, then we read it as if it was a letter with a dash.
ci = ć ni = ń si = ś zi = ź
But then the ćńśź sounds count as 2 letters! Don’t say zi as ź + i. It’s just ź !
And now, let’s do the clusters (called „digraphs”)
cz = like the „Ch” part in Chinese pinyin „Chi”
ch = like Polish „H” (like „H” in „Huge”)
rz = like Polish ż (like „ J ” in French „ Je ”)
sz = like the „Sh” part in Chinese pinyin „Shi”
Same as before, these clusters, even though written as manny letters, are just
one sound.
Some words to practice with:
Dzień dobry (Good morning)
Witam (Hello)
Cześć (Hi)
Tak (Yes)
Nie (No)
Dobrze (Correct/Good/Well)
Źle (Wrong/bad) {Ź = ź, Ż = ż. In case you can’t see it well)
Śniadanie (Breakfast)
Sebastian (My name)
Nóż (Knife)
